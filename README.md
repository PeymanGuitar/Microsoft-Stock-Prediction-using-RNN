# Microsoft Stock Prediction using RNN

In this project, using RNN and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) nodes we predict the stock prices of the
Microsoft Corporation for Septmeber 2019. The training set contains all stock prices of the Microsoft Corporation
from January 2009 to the end of August 2019. In order to avoid overfitting we use the built-in function
Dropout. Our model shows that it does very good in predicting the actual values of the prices and the upward and the downward trend of the Microsoft stock prices.
